### Description
**Executing Shell Commands with Java**

To run you need a running Docker with a running docker container

Build tool: **Maven**

#### OS:
##### 1. For Windows: `RunBatFile` - executing `.bat`

##### 2. For Linux: `RunLinuxCommand` - run command

##### 3. For Linux: `RunShFile` - executing `.sh`
* set up `sudo` without a password for the user "ddvubuntu":
   
   `sudo visudo`
   
   `ddvubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`

* When working with Docker Container, it takes time to execute, so I deleted `sudo docker run 6c3c2a225947`
* File `commands-test.txt` contains useful commands
